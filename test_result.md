# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Continuation of Aura Hotels HMS. Verified remaining items from backlog after pulling code from GitHub.
  Only two items were left:
    1. (P0) Guest Dashboard "Fast Check-out" QR modal — folio summary + QR to scan at front desk +
       email folio + approve balance charge from room.
    2. (P2) Rate & Channel Manager UI — page file existed but was NOT routed / not in sidebar.

frontend:
  - task: "Fast Check-out QR modal on Guest Dashboard"
    implemented: true
    working: "NA"
    file: "/app/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: true
    status_history:
        - working: "NA"
          agent: "main"
          comment: |
            Added `fastCheckoutOpen` + `checkoutComplete` state. New "Fast Check-out" primary button
            appears in the Folio section (data-testid="fast-checkout-btn"). Opens FastCheckoutModal
            (data-testid="fast-checkout-modal") — a 2-column layout with:
              LEFT (dark panel): Deterministic-generated QR (data-testid="fast-checkout-qr") +
              reservation code (data-testid="fast-checkout-code") + suite/departure chips +
              "You're checked out" banner (data-testid="checkout-complete-banner") once approved.
              RIGHT (folio): Grand total / Deposit paid / In-stay extras / Balance due
              (data-testid="fast-checkout-balance") + extras list (data-testid="fast-checkout-extras")
              + card-on-file notice + two CTAs: "Approve room charge" (data-testid="approve-room-charge-btn")
              and "Email folio" (data-testid="fast-checkout-email").
            Approving zeroes balance, clears extras, toggles button to "Balance settled", shows the
            checked-out banner, and fires a toast.

          comment: |
            Page `/admin/pages/RateChannel.jsx` was already implemented but not wired.
            Added:
              • Route /admin/rate-channel in App.js (guarded by permission key "rate-channel")
              • New "Revenue" sidebar group in AdminLayout with data-testid="nav-rate-channel"
              • Command palette entry "Rate & Channel"
              • Permission entry in roles.js allowing SUPER_ADMIN, GM, ACCOUNTING, MARKETING, READ_ONLY
              • Custom-role builder module key updated from "rate-manager" to "rate-channel"
            Verified visually: sidebar shows entry, page loads with OTA Connections + Master Rate
            Calendar tabs.

      message: |
        Two remaining backlog items done. No backend changes were needed (fully frontend). Please
        run the frontend testing agent focused on:
          1. /dashboard — click "Fast Check-out" button → modal appears → QR + folio summary render →
             click "Approve room charge" → balance becomes $0 and button shows "Balance settled" +
             "You're checked out" banner appears + toast fires. Also verify "Email folio" button toast.
          2. /admin/login (gm@aurahotels.com / anything) → sidebar has "Revenue > Rate & Channel" →
             clicking it loads the Rate & Channel Manager page with both OTA Connections and
             Master Rate Calendar tabs.
